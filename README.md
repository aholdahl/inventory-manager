# Inventory Management Application

An online seller fulfills customer orders placed on the sellerâ€™s website, and maintains stock of multiple products in their warehouse. The online seller uses inventory management software to accomplish these needs.

The warehouse is divided into multiple bins (shelves or areas of the warehouse) to hold inventory. A bin can contain multiple different products, and a product can have inventory in multiple different bins.

Your task is to develop a web application, using your language and frameworks of choice, that will allow warehouse staff to view, create, edit, and delete: Products, Bins, Inventory Levels, and Orders. Data should be stored in a SQL database of your choice.

Your project delivery should include all source code, and a copy of your database files, as either an .MDF file, a. .BAK file, or one or more .SQL files.

While we encourage using C# and Microsoft SQL Server, please use whatever language and SQL database you are most comfortable with.
